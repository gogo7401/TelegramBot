Automated Telegram Bot to post in Telegram Channel/Group

Telegram Channels are a vital tool for broadcasting messages to a theoretically unlimited audience. As for Telegram Groups (supporting communities of up to 200,000 and counting), they serve a similar function only that member can interact directly with each other among other things.

Telegram Channels and Groups by themselves can be a lot of work to manage. Unless you donâ€™t intend to keep your followers for long, you need fresh content regularly streaming in. The smart move is to create Telegram bot to automate the process.
